#### Data Cleaning/Preparation
Data cleaning is a crucial step in preparing data for analysis. Using Excel, you can perform various data cleaning tasks to ensure your dataset is accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis.
The following are data cleaning processes that we carried out;
   - Standardizing data 
   - Removing Duplicates
   - Removing Nulls
- Data Set

#### Standardizing Data
Standardizing data is crucial in data cleaning process because it ensures data consistency across the dataset.
Facilitates accurate analysis and reporting. 

We created the age groups using the IF() formula.

#### Checking for Nulls
Removing nulls in the data cleaning process is important because it prevents errors in analysis and calculations.
Ensures the completeness and reliability of the dataset.

In this section we utilised the CTRL+G to chec for nulls but there were no nulls found.
